I am a non-CS student and studied <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_laboratory_scientist'>MLS</a> in university. But my passion and love in Computer Science and programming in general lead me to this direction. I hope to get closer to computers world day by day.
I love contributing on Github repos, Learning more about Linux and C lang, Getting a deeper and deeper understanding of React & Typescript project and after all be a better programmer than I was yesterday.
Also I enjoy drawing :P

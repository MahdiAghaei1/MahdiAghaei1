I am a non-CS student and I studied <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_laboratory_scientist'>MLS</a> in university. But my passion and love in Computer Science and programming in general lead me to this direction. I like contributing on Github repos, Learning more about Software engeenering and Getting more confortable with Linux and CLI. Also I enjoy drawing :P
